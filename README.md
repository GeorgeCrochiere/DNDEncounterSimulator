# DNDEncounterSimulator
A small program meaning to be used to help balance out combat encounters for DND campaigns.

With this program, intended to be editied within to code to run, users can input data on player characters to see how much health all players will have when the fight ends with one side's health has completely depleted. This has the assumption that all players attempt to attack an enemy on everythurn with no healing. Distance between players is not accounted for.

Future plans for this include making it more user friendly and having a full GUI and player creation and selection system.

This project is in its extremly early stages.
